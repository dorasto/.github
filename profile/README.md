Doras is all about bringing power to content creators, entrepreneurs and business with social media. With powerful tools like a fully customizable link in bio, mediakit, and even blog hosting. 

Majority of things outside of our primary SaaS are fully open source under licenses such as the GNU GPL v3. This is to show our commitment to the community, and help others understand code, and to contribute to what we are doing.

## Our Commitment to open source
While we're committed to open sourcing everything, there are some things we must have locked for security purposes. However, anything that isn't sensitive we're committing to as open source for our community to know we mean right by them. This allows the community to work help work on bugs, improvements, and even whole new features, should they wish.
Although the project is open source, we will not be provding any self-hosted features, due to the nature of how we've built and designed Doras.
For users who decide to help work on the codebase, we'll be rewarding them with a special badge onsite which they can choose to display or not. To those heavily committed to working on Doras and want to become full maintainers will be granted a "Community Liaison" badge which also unlocks all paid features as a thank you from us to you.
